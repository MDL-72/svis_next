      "Spring of Virtue Integrated School was founded in 2008 by a group of parents and educators. It was originally called Spring of Virtue Learning Center, but in 2012, Editha Liberato decided to change the name to Spring of Virtue Integrated School. This new name was chosen because she wanted the school to be a place where students could develop their own virtues, such as honesty and courage, rather than just learning about them from books or lectures.",
    contentText1:
      "Spring of Virtue was founded with the mission of providing an environment for children to grow up as virtuous citizens. Mrs. Liberato believed that this could be done through integrating traditional education with modern studies in order to make learning more relevant and engaging for students. They wanted their school to focus on creating a positive environment for students so they would not feel pressured or judged by others when they made mistakes or did something wrongâ€”a belief which continues today under current leadership as well as past leaders.",
    contentText2:
      "The school opened its doors with one classroom at first, but quickly grew into two classrooms within a few years thanks to generous donations from local businesses and individuals who believed in its mission: Rising above our differences to create a community where everyone can thrive.",
